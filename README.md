# The Trickster
This mod adds **The Trickster**: a Rare Joker which has a 1 in 2 chance to copy the ability of a Legendary Joker each round.  
It can copy only vanilla Jokers, so: Caino, Triboulet, Yorick, Chicot and Perkeo.  
The mod also adds two Vouchers linked to The Trickster.  

Huge thanks to @Eremel for making this possible.
